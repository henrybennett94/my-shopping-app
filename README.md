## Introduction



## UX Design

This application was designed using Balsamiq to create wireframes. The method of the design was to conform to user stories.

### User Stories for My Shopping App:

- As a site user I can create new empty shopping lists so that I can add items I need e.g., groceries, to a list, as a memory aid.
- As a site user I can add items to a shopping list as dynamic entries so that I can edit within my shopping list itself, to reflect what I think is needed.
- As a site user I can create a user account with a username and password so that access to how I use the  site is private to me and protected.
- As a site user I can create a user account with a username and password so that access  to how I use the site is private to me and protected.
- As a site user I can access my user account  through a login form requiring a password so that my account's security is maintained.
- As a site user I can check off items from the list once selected to purchase so that I can keep track of my shopping while I am doing it.
- As a site user I can have the option to delete lists, and items individually from lists, that I no ,onger need to be there so that I can keep my user space organised and easy to manage.
- As a site user I can get asked to confirm that I wish to delete a feature, after selecting a delete option so that the risk of accidentally deleting something is minimised.

## Development

The project was attempted using Agile Methodology. User stories were mapped to a Github Projects project board to chart development progress. User stories were also assigned to one of two milestones: **Shopping List**, and **User Registration and Sign in**. Unfortunately due to early development problems that were not resolved, neither milestone was reached and no user story was able to be completed fully.

## Technology used

Python, HTML, CSS, Django, Cloudinary

### Python

### HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create the structure of the web pages in this application. It provides the skeleton for the app's interface, defining elements such as buttons, images, and text content.
### CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling the HTML elements. It enhances the visual presentation of the app by controlling the layout, colors, fonts, and overall look and feel. 
### Django
### Cloudinary
